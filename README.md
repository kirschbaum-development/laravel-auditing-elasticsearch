The `queue` key of the config file should look like so:

```

    ...
```

OR

```
    ...
    'queue' => env('AUDIT_QUEUE', [
        'queue' => 'default',
        'connection' => 'redis'
    ]),
    ...
```

The `driver` key of the config file should look like so:

```
    ...
    'driver' => Iconscout\Auditing\Drivers\ElasticSearch::class,
    ...
```

The `drivers` key of the config file should look like so:

```
    ...
    'drivers' => [
        'database' => [
            'table'      => 'audits',
            'connection' => null,
        ],
        'es' => [
            'client' => [
                'hosts' => [
                    env('AUDIT_HOST', 'localhost:9200')
                ]
            ],
            'index' => env('AUDIT_INDEX', 'laravel_auditing'),
        ],
    ],
    ...
```

```
<?php
namespace App\Models;

use Iconscout\Auditing\Drivers\ElasticSearch;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use OwenIt\Auditing\Auditable;
use OwenIt\Auditing\Contracts\Auditable as AuditableContract;

class SomeModel extends Model implements AuditableContract
{
    use Auditable;

    /**
     * ElasticSearch Audit Driver
     *
     * @var Iconscout\Auditing\Drivers\ElasticSearch
     */
    protected $auditDriver = ElasticSearch::class;

    // ...
}
```

You can use the ElasticSearchAuditable trait in any Auditable model like so in order to retrieving Retrieving audit records records from elasticsearch:

```
<?php
namespace App\Models;

use Iconscout\Auditing\Drivers\ElasticSearch;
use Iconscout\Auditing\Traits\ElasticSearchAuditable;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use OwenIt\Auditing\Auditable;
use OwenIt\Auditing\Contracts\Auditable as AuditableContract;

class SomeModel extends Model implements AuditableContract
{
    use Auditable, ElasticSearchAuditable;

    /**
     * ElasticSearch Audit Driver
     *
     * @var Iconscout\Auditing\Drivers\ElasticSearch
     */
    protected $auditDriver = ElasticSearch::class;

    // ...
}
```

```
// Get first available Icon
$icon = Icon::first();

// Get all associated Audits
$all = $icon->esAudits;

// Get all associated Audits via parameters ($page & $perPage)
$all = $icon->esAudits($page = 1, $perPage = 10);
```
